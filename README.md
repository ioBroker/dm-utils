# dm-utils

Utility classes for ioBroker adapters to support [ioBroker.device-manager](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.device-manager).

## How to use

Add in your `io-package.json` the property `deviceManager: true` to `common.supportedMessages`.
Note: If you don't have a `common.supportedMessages` property yet, you have to add it.
Also, if you don't have a `common.supportedMessages.messagebox: true` property yet, you have to add it. If common.messagebox exists, you can remove it. (see 
https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.js-controller/blob/274f9e8f84dbdaaba9830a6cc00ddf083e989090/schemas/io-package.json#L754C104-L754C178)

In your ioBroker adapter, add a subclass of `DeviceManagement` and override the methods you need (see next chapters):

Example:

- Create a subclass:

```ts
class MyAdapterDeviceManagement extends DeviceManagement<MyAdapter> {
    // contents see in the next chapters
}
```

- Instantiate the subclass in your adapter class constructor:

```ts
class MyAdapter extends utils.Adapter {
    private readonly deviceManagement: MyAdapterDeviceManagement;

    public constructor(options: Partial<utils.AdapterOptions> = {}) {
        super({
            ...options,
            name: "my-adapter",
        });
        this.deviceManagement = new DmTestDeviceManagement(this);

        // ... more code here
    }
}
```

## Core concepts

### Structure

In the UI, there are three levels of information:

- In the top level, a list of all adapter instances is shown (only containing adapter instances that support device management).
- Inside the adapter instance (when expanded), a list of devices is shown.
- Devices may contain additional details, which are shown when the row of the device is expanded.

### Actions

The device manager tab allows the user to interact with the adapter instance in two ways:

- Actions per instance are shown above the list and should contain actions like "Search devices" or "Pair new device".
- Actions per device are shown in the device list inside an instance and should contain actions like "Edit settings" or "Remove".

When the user clicks on an action (i.e., a button in the UI),
the `DeviceManagement` implementation's `handleXxxAction()` is called, and the adapter can perform arbitrary actions
(see below for details).

### Controls

The device manager tab allows the user to control devices too. If devices are controllable, the device manager tab shows a control elements in the device card.

When the user clicks on a control (i.e., a button in the UI),
the `DeviceManagement` implementation's `handleXxxAction()` is called, and the adapter can perform arbitrary actions
(see below for details).

### Communication

The communication between the `ioBroker.device-manager` tab and the adapter happens through `sendTo`.

**IMPORTANT:** make sure your adapter doesn't handle `sendTo` messages starting with `dm:`, otherwise the communication will not work.

### Access adapter methods

You can access all adapter methods like `getState()` or `getStateAsync()` via `this.adapter`.  
Example: `this.getState()` -> `this.adapter.getState()`

## `DeviceManagement` methods to override

All methods can either return an object of the defined value or a `Promise` resolving to the object.

This allows you to implement the method synchronously or asynchronously, depending on your implementation.

### `listDevices()`

This method must always be overridden (as it is abstract in the base class).

You must return an array with information about all devices of this adapter's instance.

This method is called when the user expands an instance in the list.

In most cases, you will get all states of your instance and fill the array with the relevant information.

Every array entry is an object of type `DeviceInfo` which has the following properties:

- `id` (string): a unique (human-readable) identifier of the device (it must be unique for your adapter instance only)
- `name` (string or translations): the human-readable name of this device
- `status` (optional): the current status of the device, which can be one of:
  - `"disconnected"`
  - `"connected"`
  - an object containing:
    - `icon` (string): an icon depicting the status of the device (see below for details)
    - `description` (string, optional): a text that will be shown as a tooltip on the status
- `actions` (array, optional): an array of actions that can be performed on the device; each object contains:
  - `id` (string): unique identifier to recognize an action (never shown to the user)
  - `icon` (string): an icon shown on the button (see below for details)
  - `description` (string, optional): a text that will be shown as a tooltip on the button
  - `disabled` (boolean, optional): if set to `true`, the button can't be clicked but is shown to the user
- `hasDetails` (boolean, optional): if set to `true`, the row of the device can be expanded and details are shown below

### `getInstanceInfo()`

This method allows the device manager tab to gather some general information about the instance. It is called when the user opens the tab.

If you override this method, the returned object must contain:

- `apiVersion` (string): the supported API version; must currently always be `"v1"`
- `actions` (array, optional): an array of actions that can be performed on the instance; each object contains:
  - `id` (string): unique identifier to recognize an action (never shown to the user)
  - `icon` (string): an icon shown on the button (see below for details)
  - `title` (string): the title shown next to the icon on the button
  - `description` (string, optional): a text that will be shown as a tooltip on the button
  - `disabled` (boolean, optional): if set to `true`, the button can't be clicked but is shown to the user

### `getDeviceDetails(id: string)`

This method is called if a device's `hasDetails` is set to `true` and the user clicks on the expander.

The returned object must contain:

- `id` (string): the `id` given as parameter to the method call
- `schema` (Custom JSON form schema): the schema of the Custom JSON form to show below the device information
- `data` (object, optional): the data used to populate the Custom JSON form

For more details about the schema, see [here](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.admin/blob/master/src-rx/src/components/JsonConfigComponent/SCHEMA.md).

Please keep in mind that there is no "Save" button, so in most cases, the form shouldn't contain editable fields, but you may use `sendTo<xxx>` objects to send data to the adapter.

### `handleInstanceAction(actionId: string, context: ActionContext)

This method is called when to user clicks on an action (i.e., button) for an adapter instance.

The parameters of this method are:
- `actionId` (string): the `id` that was given in `getInstanceInfo()` --> `actions[].id`
- `context` (object): object containing helper methods that can be used when executing the action

The returned object must contain:
- `refresh` (boolean): set this to `true` if you want the list to be reloaded after this action

This method can be implemented asynchronously and can take a lot of time to complete.

See below for how to interact with the user.

### `handleDeviceAction(deviceId: string, actionId: string, context: ActionContext)

This method is called when the user clicks on an action (i.e., button) for a device.

The parameters of this method are:
- `deviceId` (string): the `id` that was given in `listDevices()` --> `[].id`
- `actionId` (string): the `id` that was given in `listDevices()` --> `[].actions[].id`
- `context` (object): object containing helper methods that can be used when executing the action

The returned object must contain:
- `refresh` (string / boolean): the following values are allowed:
    - `"device"`: if you want the device details to be reloaded after this action
    - `"instance"`: if you want the entire device list to be reloaded after this action
    - `false`: if you don't want anything to be refreshed (important: this is a boolean, not a string!)

This method can be implemented asynchronously and can take a lot of time to complete.

See below for how to interact with the user.

### `handleDeviceControl(deviceId: string, controlId: string, state: ControlState, context: MessageContext)

This method is called when the user clicks on a control (i.e., slider) in the device card.

The parameters of this method are:
- `deviceId` (string): the `id` that was given in `listDevices()` --> `[].id`
- `controlId` (string): the `id` that was given in `listDevices()` --> `[].controls[].id`. There are some reserved control names, you can find the list below.
- `state` (string | number | boolean): new state for the control, that will be sent to a real device
- `context` (object): object containing helper methods that can be used when executing the action

The returned object must contain:
- `state`: ioBroker state object

This method can be implemented asynchronously and can take a lot of time to complete.

### `handleDeviceControlState(deviceId: string, controlId: string, context: MessageContext)

This method is called when GUI requests the update of the state.

The parameters of this method are:
- `deviceId` (string): the `id` that was given in `listDevices()` --> `[].id`
- `controlId` (string): the `id` that was given in `listDevices()` --> `[].controls[].id`
- `context` (object): object containing helper methods that can be used when executing the action

The returned object must contain:
- `state`: ioBroker state object

This method can be implemented asynchronously and can take a lot of time to complete.

## Action sequences

To allow your adapter to interact with the user, you can use "actions".

As described above, there are actions on the instance and on devices. The behavior of both methods is similar.

Inside an action method (`handleInstanceAction()` or `handleDeviceAction()`) you can perform arbitrary actions, like talking to a device or API, and you can interact with the user.
For interactions, there are methods you can call on `context`:

There are some reserved action names, you can find the list below:
- `status` - This action is called when the user clicks on the status icon. So to implement the "click-on-status" functionality, the developer has to implement this action.
- `disable` - This action will be called when the user clicks on the `enabled` icon. `disable` and `enable` actions cannot be together.
- `enable` - This action will be called when the user clicks on the `disabled` icon. `disable` and `enable` actions cannot be together.

### `showMessage(text: ioBroker.StringOrTranslated)`

Shows a message to the user.

The method has the following parameter:
- `text` (string or translation): the text to show to the user

This asynchronous method returns (or rather: the Promise is resolved) once the user has clicked on "OK".

### `showConfirmation(text: ioBroker.StringOrTranslated)`

Lets the user confirm an action by showing a message with an "OK" and "Cancel" button.

The method has the following parameter:
- `text` (string or translation): the text to show to the user

This asynchronous method returns (or rather: the Promise is resolved) once the user has clicked a button in the dialog:
- `true` if the user clicked "OK"
- `false` if the user clicked "Cancel"

### `showForm(schema: JsonFormSchema, options?: { data?: JsonFormData; title?: string })`

Shows a dialog with a Custom JSON form that can be edited by the user.

The method has the following parameters:
- `schema` (Custom JSON form schema): the schema of the Custom JSON form to show in the dialog
- `options` (object, optional): options to configure the dialog further
  - `data` (object, optional): the data used to populate the Custom JSON form
  - `title` (string, optional): the dialog title

This asynchronous method returns (or rather: the Promise is resolved) once the user has clicked a button in the dialog:
- the form data, if the user clicked "OK"
- `undefined`, if the user clicked "Cancel"

### `openProgress(title: string, options?: {indeterminate?: boolean, value?: number, label?: string})`

Shows a dialog with a linear progress bar to the user. There is no way for the user to dismiss this dialog.

The method has the following parameters:
- `title` (string): the dialog title
- `options` (object, optional): options to configure the dialog further
  - `indeterminate` (boolean, optional): set to `true` to visualize an unspecified wait time
  - `value` (number, optional): the progress value to show to the user (if set, it must be a value between 0 and 100)
  - `label` (string, optional): label to show to the right of the progress bar; you may show the progress value in a human-readable way (e.g. "42%") or show the current step in a multi-step progress (e.g. "Logging in...")

This method returns a promise that resolves to a `ProgressDialog` object.

**Important:** you must always call `close()` on the returned object before you may open any other dialog.

`ProgressDialog` has two methods:

- `update(update: { title?: string; indeterminate?: boolean; value?:number; label?: string; })`
  - Updates the progress dialog with new values
  - The method has the following parameter:
    - `update` (object): what to update in the dialog
      - `title` (string, optional): change the dialog title
      - `indeterminate` (boolean, optional): change whether the progress is indeterminate
      - `value` (number, optional): change the progress value
      - `label` (string, optional): change the label to the right of the progress bar
- `close()`
  - Closes the progress dialog (and allows you to open other dialogs)
